# Rice Cooker App

## Introduction

The Rice Cooker App is a command-line application that emulates the functionality of a rice cooker. Users can perform various actions, including preparing existing recipes or manually setting temperature and duration for cooking.

## Instructions

1. **Plug in the Rice Cooker**
   - Ensure the rice cooker is connected to a power source before starting any operation.

2. **Put Something On to Cook**
   - Choose your desired action:
     - **Existing Recipe (Option 1):** Select from available recipes (e.g., Rice or Egg).
     - **Manual (Option 2):** Set temperature and duration manually.

3. **Start the Rice Cooker**
   - Once the recipe and ingredients are selected, start the rice cooker to initiate the cooking process.

4. **Empty the Rice Cooker**
   - After the cooking process is complete, the app will prompt you to empty the rice cooker.

5. **Switch Off**
   - Turn off the rice cooker to conclude the cooking process.

6. **Unplug the Rice Cooker**
   - For safety, unplug the rice cooker from the power source.

## Error Explanation

### Validation for Numeric Input
- If an error occurs while entering numeric values (e.g., temperature, duration, quantity), the application will prompt you to enter a valid non-negative number.

### Operation Cancellation
- If you decide to cancel the ongoing operation, the application allows you to exit gracefully, providing a message indicating the cancellation.

### Unknown Choices
- If you input an unrecognized choice during the menu selection, the application will exit with an "Operation canceled" message.

## Running the App

1. Ensure you have PHP installed on your machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the PHP script.
4. Run the script using the command: `php script_name.php`
